  description: "I saw it again tonight. \r\n\r\nThe shadow. It\u2019s in the corner
    by my closet. \r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t move. It just watches me. I told Mom and
    Dad, but they said it\u2019s just my imagination. \r\n\r\nIT\u2019S NOT! \r\n\r\n
    I tried to sleep with the light on, but it\u2019s still there. It\u2019s like
    it\u2019s waiting for something. I think it wants me to come closer, but I\u2019m
    too scared.  What if it\u2019s real? \r\n\r\nTonight is <u><b>Friday</b></u>,
    I heard it calling from the bathroom mirror.\r\n\r\nI was afraid but I asked
    <b><u>it what it wants</u></b>\r"
