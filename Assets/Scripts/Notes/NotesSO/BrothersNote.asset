  description: "I saw it again tonight. \n\nThe shadow. It\u2019s in the corner by
    my closet. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t move. It just watches me. I told Mom and Dad,
    but they said it\u2019s just my imagination. \n\nIT\u2019S NOT! \n\n I tried
    to sleep with the light on, but it\u2019s still there. It\u2019s like it\u2019s
    waiting for something. I think it wants me to come closer, but I\u2019m too scared. 
    What if it\u2019s real? \n\nWhat if it\u2019s not just a shadow? I wish they
    would believe me. I don\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nPlease don\u2019t let it
    get me."
