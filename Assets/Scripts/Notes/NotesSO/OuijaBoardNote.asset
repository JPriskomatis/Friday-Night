  description: 'I''m starting to believe our house was always like this. Think about
    it.

    Ever since I was young I remember just feeling this tension, this negativity
    on the air. I just thought we were a broken family.



    Now I get why Jason
    left us here all alone, shit he probably knew something was going on.



    My
    only way to survive is find where this curse is coming from and stop it.
