  description: 'I tried contacting it


    I used the old ouija board I found in
    the basement. I thought maybe I could convince it to go away and let me alone.


    I
    closed all lights and lit a candle. After that I got the board and asked the
    first question.


    It didn''t answer. I asked over 30 questions, but received
    no answer.


    How did you die? Why you do this?


    Where are you?


    Then
    I got up and went to bathroom and I swear when I can back the arrow was moved.'
