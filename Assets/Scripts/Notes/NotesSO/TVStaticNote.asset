  description: 'I run and run, but had nowhere it hide.

    

    In the end it
    always found me, I don''t know how.

    

    and I don''t know why it didn''t
    kill me like it did with my parents.


    Its toying with me for nights.


    I
    was able to hear its voice through the tv.

    

    It asked me a question.'
